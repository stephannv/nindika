# How to contribute to nindika

## 🐞 Did you find a bug?
If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible. A screenshot with problem or a step by showing how to reproduce the bug will help a lot.

## ✨ Do your have a feature request?

Start a new discussion at [Github Discussions](https://github.com/stephannv/nindika/discussions/new).

## 👩🏾‍💻👨🏻‍💻 You are a developer / designer
Please ask first before you put in work for a pull request. Things are constantly being worked on, and it is very difficult to share everything publicly in a meaningful way. So asking lets us avoid working on the same thing, or worse, someone putting in a lot of work for a PR that does not fit into the scope of the project.

Ps.: You work should be built on top of `main` branch.
